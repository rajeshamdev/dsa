Thread trying to acquire the lock will busy wait until the resource is
unlocked. It is usually scalar variable with zero if available and one if
unavailable.

spinlock_t *s;
spin_init(spinlock_t *s)
{
    *s = 0;
}

void spin_lock(spinlock_t *s)
{
    while (test_and_set(s) != 0)
        while (*s != 0); // busy wait
}

void spin_unlock(spinlock_t *s)
{
    *s = 0;
}
