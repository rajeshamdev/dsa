                 Signals
                 -------
Signals are expensive for IPC - the sender must make a system call, the kernel must
interrupt the receiver and extensively manipulate its stack so as to invoke its handler
and later resume the interrupted code. Also they have limited bandwidth (31 signals)
and it is not possible to send additional info or arguments.
