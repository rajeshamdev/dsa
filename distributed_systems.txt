A distributed system:
 -> is a collection of entities;
 -> each of these entities being autonomous,
 -> programmable
 -> asynchronous
 -> failure-prone
 -> entities communicate through an unreliable communication medium.

The key goals of a distributed system include:
 -> Transparency: Looks like a single single withour details of the location,
    access, migration, concurrency, failure, relocation, persistence and
    resources to the users.
 -> Openness: Making the network easier to configure and modify.
 -> Reliability: Compared to a single system, a distributed system should be
    highly capable of being secure, consistent and have a high capability of
    masking errors.
 -> Performance: Compared to other models, distributed models are expected
    to give a much-wanted boost to performance.
 -> Scalability: Distributed systems should be scalable with respect to
    geography, administration or size.

Challenges for the distributed system include:
 -> Security is a big challenge in a distributed environment, especially
    when using public networks.
 -> Fault tolerance could be tough when the distributed model is built
    based on unreliable components.
 -> Coordination and resource sharing can be difficult if proper protocols
    or policies are not in place.
