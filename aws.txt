AWS storage and content delivery:
--------------------------------

1) S3:
   - objecct storage.
   - logically groups related files into buckets.
   - stores files/images/audio/video.
   - does not support databases.
   - scalable and durable storage service.
   - no pre-provisiong fpr space needed.
2) EBS: just like a raw disk. Multiple EC2 instances cannot use
   simultaneously.
3) Glacier: Backup/archival scenarios. Write many times. Read less.
4) Elastic file system: Auto scales up/down as per load. Multiple EC2
   instances can share.
5) AWS CloudFront: content delivery network. S3 is the underlying
   storage for CloudFront.

The default storage with EC2 instances is not persistent (and volatile).
Also the storage cannot be scaled up/down.
